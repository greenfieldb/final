    <div class="about">
    <p>I am currently a Digital Media and Design major at UCONN, and have completed my first year in the program.  While my interest lies in several areas, my goal is to gain exposure to variety of potential career opportunities while broadening my skill set in a professional setting.
I have always loved to create, and began my journey at the Culinary Institute of America with the goal of becoming a professional chef.  When I realized this was not going to be the right career for me, I continued my studies at Norwalk Community College, eventually transferring to UCONN.  Digital Media and Design has been an excellent fit for me, as it has enabled me to combine my interest in media and technology with my passion for creativity.  I am also drawn to digital media because it provides a way to connect with people on a large scale, ideally, in a way that will make some kind of an impact.
	I am a very open minded person, always looking to explore new ideas and push boundaries. I believe hard work, and finding a way to define myself, is important for success, as is learning to collaborate with others and working together to achieve a common goal.  Finally, I now have the confidence and focus of someone who has taken the time to explore their options, and knows they are on the right path. These are the qualities I can bring to your company.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Ben Greenfield
